# README: Data Exploration and Preprocessing for Bank Marketing Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on exploring and preprocessing the **Bank Marketing dataset**, which contains demographic and financial information about bank customers. The goal is to clean and prepare the raw data for further analysis and visualization, ensuring that it is suitable for building reliable predictive models. This document outlines the approach taken, including data exploration, preprocessing, handling missing values, and outlier detection.

## Approach

### 1. Data Exploration

#### 1.1 Data Preprocessing
The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the raw data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and make the dataset ready for analysis. The following steps were taken:

- **Importing Python Libraries**: Essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` were imported for data manipulation and visualization.
  
- **Reading Datasets**: Two datasets, `bank-full.csv` and `bank-additional-full.csv`, were loaded into DataFrames for exploration.

- **Data Discovery**: The shape of the datasets was examined to understand the number of rows and columns. The `info()` method was used to check for missing values and data types, confirming that all columns in the primary dataset contained non-null values.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics were generated for numerical columns to gain insights into the data, including mean, standard deviation, and potential outliers.

### 2. Handling Missing Data
Categorical columns were analyzed for "unknown" values. The following steps were taken to handle missing data:

- **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**: Columns with a high number of "unknown" values, such as `poutcome` and `contact`, were removed from the dataset.

- **Removing Rows with "Unknown" Values**: Rows with "unknown" values in critical columns like `job` and `education` were excluded to enhance data quality.

### 3. Outlier Detection
Outliers in numerical variables were identified using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is suitable for high-dimensional datasets and does not assume a normal distribution. The following steps were taken:

- **Model Fitting**: The Isolation Forest model was fitted to the cleaned numerical data, with an expectation that 5% of the data would be outliers.

- **Outlier Prediction**: Predictions were made to identify outliers, which were then removed from the dataset, resulting in a final cleaned dataset.

### 4. Convert categorical variables to numerical
Converting categorical variables to numerical values ensures compatibility with machine learning algorithms, improves model performance, enhances interpretability, and facilitates more efficient data storage and processing. 

- **One-Hot Encoded**: This Encoding method fits becasue the data set showing small to medium cardinality and has nominal categorical variables where categories do not have a meaningful order.

### 5. Scale the variables
Scaling variables ensures that all features are on a comparable scale, improving model performance, reducing bias, enhancing interpretability, and maintaining numerical stability.

- **StandardScaler**: Using StandardScaler ensures that the numerical features in the DataFrame are standardized to a common scale. This normalization can significantly enhance model performanceand and ensure that features with different units do not bias the model. It will also give better support for algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN), k-means clustering which rely on distance metrics, scaled features ensure that no single feature dominates the distance calculations.

### 6. *Univariate Analysis*
Univariate analysis provides insights into the distribution and characteristics of individual features, highlighting trends, patterns, and relationships with the target variable. By analyzing continuous and categorical variables, it helps identify outliers, skewness, and imbalances, which can impact model performance. This analysis is crucial for understanding the data structure and selecting relevant features, ensuring informed decisions for further modeling and improving overall model effectiveness.

- Age: The age distribution is slightly right-skewed, with most clients between 20-60 years old, peaking in the early 30s. This suggests that individuals in their 30s are more likely to subscribe to term deposits, indicating they are at a financially stable point in life and more interested in planning for future savings.

- Balance: The balance distribution is also right-skewed, with the majority of clients having lower balances (peaking around 1000), while a small group holds significantly higher balances. This implies that most clients have modest savings, but a minority possess substantially larger amounts, which could reflect a more affluent client segment.

- Duration: The right-skewed distribution of conversation durations indicates that most client interactions last between 0-300 seconds. Notably, the frequency of contacts lasting 151-300 seconds matches the frequency of shorter 0-150 seconds contacts, suggesting that clients are engaging in relatively longer conversations (2-3 minutes). This is a positive sign for potential sales as it reflects a higher level of customer interest and willingness to communicate.

- Campaign: The number of contacts in the current campaign shows a right-skewed distribution, with the majority of clients being contacted only once or twice. There's a sharp drop-off as the number of contacts increases, indicating that most clients do not require multiple follow-ups, suggesting that initial contact is often sufficient to generate interest or responses.

- Pdays: The days since the last contact follow a right-skewed distribution, indicating that most clients have relatively short intervals (within a month) between contacts. This suggests that clients are engaged with the campaign on a relatively frequent basis, while a smaller group experiences longer gaps, which might imply less engagement or more irregular outreach.

- Previous: The number of previous contacts also exhibits a right-skewed distribution, with the majority of clients having zero or only a few prior interactions before the current campaign. This indicates that most clients are relatively new to the campaign or have only had a limited number of previous contacts, suggesting that ongoing engagement and follow-up efforts may still be in the early stages for many clients.

- Housing Status: The majority of clients have a housing loan, suggesting that owning a home is common among this group. This could indicate financial stability or a tendency to invest in property.

- Loan Status: A large portion of clients do not have a personal loan, which may indicate that they are either debt-averse or able to manage their finances without relying on additional borrowing.

- Subscribed (Term Deposit): The low subscription rate for term deposits suggests that most clients are either not interested in long-term savings products or are not yet financially ready to commit to such investments.

# README: Data Exploration and Preprocessing for Bank Marketing Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on exploring and preprocessing the **Bank Marketing dataset**, which contains demographic and financial information about bank customers. The goal is to clean and prepare the raw data for further analysis and visualization, ensuring that it is suitable for building reliable predictive models. This document outlines the approach taken, including data exploration, preprocessing, handling missing values, and outlier detection.

## Approach

### 1. Data Exploration

#### 1.1 Data Preprocessing
The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the raw data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and make the dataset ready for analysis. The following steps were taken:

- **Importing Python Libraries**: Essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` were imported for data manipulation and visualization.
  
- **Reading Datasets**: Two datasets, `bank-full.csv` and `bank-additional-full.csv`, were loaded into DataFrames for exploration.

- **Data Discovery**: The shape of the datasets was examined to understand the number of rows and columns. The `info()` method was used to check for missing values and data types, confirming that all columns in the primary dataset contained non-null values.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics were generated for numerical columns to gain insights into the data, including mean, standard deviation, and potential outliers.

### 2. Handling Missing Data
Categorical columns were analyzed for "unknown" values. The following steps were taken to handle missing data:

- **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**: Columns with a high number of "unknown" values, such as `poutcome` and `contact`, were removed from the dataset.

- **Removing Rows with "Unknown" Values**: Rows with "unknown" values in critical columns like `job` and `education` were excluded to enhance data quality.

### 3. Outlier Detection
Outliers in numerical variables were identified using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is suitable for high-dimensional datasets and does not assume a normal distribution. The following steps were taken:

- **Model Fitting**: The Isolation Forest model was fitted to the cleaned numerical data, with an expectation that 5% of the data would be outliers.

- **Outlier Prediction**: Predictions were made to identify outliers, which were then removed from the dataset, resulting in a final cleaned dataset.

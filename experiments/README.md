# README: Data Exploration and Preprocessing for Bank Marketing Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on exploring and preprocessing the **Bank Marketing dataset**, which contains demographic and financial information about bank customers. The goal is to clean and prepare the raw data for further analysis and visualization, ensuring that it is suitable for building reliable predictive models. This document outlines the approach taken, including data exploration, preprocessing, handling missing values, and outlier detection.

## Approach

### 1. Data Exploration

#### 1.1 Data Preprocessing
The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the raw data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and make the dataset ready for analysis. The following steps were taken:

- **Importing Python Libraries**: Essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` were imported for data manipulation and visualization.
  
- **Reading Datasets**: Two datasets, `bank-full.csv` and `bank-additional-full.csv`, were loaded into DataFrames for exploration.

- **Data Discovery**: The shape of the datasets was examined to understand the number of rows and columns. The `info()` method was used to check for missing values and data types, confirming that all columns in the primary dataset contained non-null values.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics were generated for numerical columns to gain insights into the data, including mean, standard deviation, and potential outliers.

### 2. Handling Missing Data
Categorical columns were analyzed for "unknown" values. The following steps were taken to handle missing data:

- **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**: Columns with a high number of "unknown" values, such as `poutcome` and `contact`, were removed from the dataset.

- **Removing Rows with "Unknown" Values**: Rows with "unknown" values in critical columns like `job` and `education` were excluded to enhance data quality.

### 3. Outlier Detection
Outliers in numerical variables were identified using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is suitable for high-dimensional datasets and does not assume a normal distribution. The following steps were taken:

- **Model Fitting**: The Isolation Forest model was fitted to the cleaned numerical data, with an expectation that 5% of the data would be outliers.

- **Outlier Prediction**: Predictions were made to identify outliers, which were then removed from the dataset, resulting in a final cleaned dataset.

### 4. Convert categorical variables to numerical
Converting categorical variables to numerical values ensures compatibility with machine learning algorithms, improves model performance, enhances interpretability, and facilitates more efficient data storage and processing. 

- **One-Hot Encoded**: This Encoding method fits becasue the data set showing small to medium cardinality and has nominal categorical variables where categories do not have a meaningful order.

### 5. Scale the variables
Scaling variables ensures that all features are on a comparable scale, improving model performance, reducing bias, enhancing interpretability, and maintaining numerical stability.

- **StandardScaler**: Using StandardScaler ensures that the numerical features in the DataFrame are standardized to a common scale. This normalization can significantly enhance model performanceand and ensure that features with different units do not bias the model. It will also give better support for algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN), k-means clustering which rely on distance metrics, scaled features ensure that no single feature dominates the distance calculations.

### 6. *Univariate Analysis*
Univariate analysis provides insights into the distribution and characteristics of individual features, highlighting trends, patterns, and relationships with the target variable. By analyzing continuous and categorical variables, it helps identify outliers, skewness, and imbalances, which can impact model performance. This analysis is crucial for understanding the data structure and selecting relevant features, ensuring informed decisions for further modeling and improving overall model effectiveness.
